'Notification Manager' application is enhanced from the traditional paper-based management system. 

The 'Notification Manager' has been developed to override the problems facing in the manual system present today. By using 'Notification Manager' the student will get notified about everything the administrator posts on it. Administrator can be the Event Manager, Staff Member, or the person who is operating everything in the application. 

The entire application is built on the trending technology called 'Firebase' a Google Inc. product for its backend functionality. Firebase provides different services such as Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime database, Firebase Crash Reporting, Firebase Remote Config and so on according to the user needs.
